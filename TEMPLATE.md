## Introduction

## Getting Started
### Creating Your Own Module
To create your own module, you can fork the template repository and create your own knowledge module. Each module must contain a `*.llm` file which contains the knowledge you are interested in adding. 

Example `*.llm` file: 
```
  {
    "name": "XXXX",
    "description": "DESCRIPTION",
    "access": 1,
    "knowledge": ["A", "B", "C",... "Z"]
  }
```
